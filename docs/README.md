# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Project Management Process Summary

Our process covers the full project lifecycle:

- **Project Initiation:** Validate ideas, align stakeholders, and create a project one-pager summarizing goals, success metrics, timeline, and risks. Decisions to proceed are clearly documented.
- **Project Planning:** Break down work into shippable increments; estimate effort; identify dependencies, risks, and milestones; and create a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria.
- **Execution & Tracking:** Teams work in sprints or iterations, participate in daily standups, demo regularly, and use boards for tracking. Code quality and testing practices (automated and manual) are embedded in our PR workflow.
- **Risk Management & Communication:** Risks are logged, monitored, and escalated as needed. Regular status updates and communication templates are used to keep all stakeholders aligned.
- **Release & Deployment:** Standardized checklists govern how we ship and verify releases, ensuring reliability and including rollback/incident playbooks.
- **Retrospectives & Improvement:** Teams reflect after each milestone to identify improvements, with action items tracked for follow-up and measurable impact.
- **Roles & Personas:** Each role—Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, and QA—has clearly defined responsibilities in project delivery.

These guides are meant to be living documents, refined as the team learns and grows.
